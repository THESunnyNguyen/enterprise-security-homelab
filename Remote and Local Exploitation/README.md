## Lab Overview

This hands-on penetration testing lab demonstrated complete exploitation techniques from reconnaissance through privilege escalation. Using the Metasploit Framework on Kali Linux, 
I successfully exploited a vulnerable PostgreSQL service, 
gained initial access, and escalated privileges to root level on a target Linux system.
